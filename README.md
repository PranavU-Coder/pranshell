# pranshell
creating my own shell from scratch

current limitations : 

> Only whitespace separating arguments, no quoting or backslash escaping.

> No piping or redirections

> Few standard builtins.

> No globbing

to install it on your system (works on arch based distros at the moment) :

```bash
yay -S pranshell
```

or 

```bash
paru -S pranshell
```
